# HR_Analytics_for_Employee_Attrition

Performed HR analytics for employee attrition using Power BI, focusing on visualizing and analyzing data to understand and predict employee turnover. The process included the following steps:

Data Collection and Preparation
Data Import: Imported employee data directly into Power BI from various sources, such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or databases. The data included employee demographics, job roles, tenure, performance ratings, and exit information.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Used Power Query within Power BI to clean and transform the data. This involved handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating calculated columns (e.g., tenure in years).
Dashboard Creation
Data Modeling: Defined relationships between different tables in Power BI to create a comprehensive data model, allowing for effective cross-table analysis.
Calculated Columns and Measures: Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures. Examples include:
Turnover Rate: Calculated as the number of employees who left divided by the average number of employees.
Average Tenure: Calculated to understand how long employees typically stay.
Attrition by Department: Created measures to visualize turnover rates across different departments.
Visualization and Analysis
Interactive Dashboards: Developed interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to visualize key attrition metrics:
Overall Attrition Rate: Displayed as a KPI or gauge to show the current attrition rate.
Attrition by Department: Bar or column charts to compare attrition rates across departments.
Attrition by Demographics: Pie charts or stacked bar charts to show attrition by age, gender, and other demographic factors.
Attrition Trends Over Time: Line charts to visualize how attrition rates change over time.
Attrition by Performance Rating: Scatter plots or heat maps to correlate performance ratings with attrition rates.
Key Insights and Actions
High-Risk Groups Identification: Used slicers and filters to identify high-risk groups by segmenting data on various attributes such as job role, tenure, and performance ratings.
Root Cause Analysis: Performed drill-down analysis to uncover potential reasons for attrition, such as dissatisfaction in specific departments or among employees with certain job roles or tenure lengths.
Insights and Recommendations
Actionable Insights: Provided HR with data-driven insights to inform retention strategies. For example, identifying departments or roles with high attrition rates to target specific interventions.
Strategic Recommendations: Recommended strategies such as improving employee engagement initiatives, offering career development programs, and revising policies in departments with high attrition rates.
